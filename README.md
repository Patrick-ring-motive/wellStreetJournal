## About Well Street Journal
This project was started as a way to view the Wall Street Journal's website wsj.com without logging in and without all the clutter. On the free version of wsj.com most of the articles only display a free preview. Well Street Journal makes it so that anyone can view the free previews without a ton of popups and without constantly being prodded to subscribe.
